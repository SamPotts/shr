# Shr

Simple, clean, customizable sharing buttons.

[Donate to support Shr](#donate) - [Checkout the demo](http://shr.one)

## Why?

The default share buttons used by the social networks are not only ugly to look at (sorry, they just are) but they usually depend on iframes, are slow and generally heavy. That led to me creating shr (short for share).

## Features

-   **Accessible** - built right, using progressive enhancement
-   **Lightweight** - just 3KB minified and gzipped
-   **Customisable** - make the buttons and count look how you want with the markup you want
-   **Semantic** - uses the _right_ elements. There's no `<span>`s as buttons type hacks
-   **Fast** - uses local storage to cache results to keep things fast
-   **No dependencies** - written in vanilla ES6 JavaScript

Oh and yes, it works with Bootstrap.

## Setup

To set up Shr, you first must include the JavaScript lib and optionally the CSS and SVG sprite if you want icons on your buttons.

### 1. HTML

Here's an example for a Facebook button, see [the demo source](https://github.com/sampotts/shr/blob/master/demo/index.html) for other examples.

```html
<a
    href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fshr.one"
    target="_blank"
    class="shr__button shr__button--facebook js-shr"
>
    <svg><use xlink:href="#shr-facebook"></use></svg>
    Share
</a>
```

This markup assumes you're using the SVG sprite (which is optional) and the default CSS. If you're not using either of these then you can omit the `shr__*` classNames completely and the `<svg>`. The `href` attribute value is used to determine the type of network. It is also used as the fallback so must be valid.

Once Shr has been initialized on a button and data has been fetched, it is manipulated as below:

```html
<span class="shr">
    <a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fshr.one"
        target="_blank"
        class="shr__button shr__button--facebook js-shr"
    >
        <svg><use xlink:href="#shr-facebook"></use></svg>
        Share
    </a>
    <span class="shr__count shr__count--after">888</span>
</span>
```

-   The outer `<span>` is a wrapper so that we can prevent the count wrapping under the button and just looking odd
-   The count `<span>` is used as the bubble for the current count for share, star or subscriber, etc
-   The className for both of these elements can be changed in [options](#options)

### 2. JavaScript

There are two ways you can get up and running with JavaScript:

#### via the npm package

If you're using npm/yarn to manage your dependencies, you can add `shr-buttons`:

```bash
npm install --save shr-buttons
```

and then in your JavaScript app:

```javascript
import Shr from 'shr-buttons';
```

#### via a `<script>` element

Add the following before you're closing `</body>`:

```html
<script src="https://shr.one/2.0.0-beta.8/shr.js"></script>
```

Alternatively add the script to your main app bundle.

##### Initialize

```javascript
const buttons = Shr.setup('.js-shr', { ...options });
```

This will setup all elements that match the `.js-shr` selector. The first argument must be either a:

-   CSS string selector that's compatible with [`querySelector`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector),
-   a [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)
-   a [NodeList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList)
-   an [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) of [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)

The `options` are the [options](#options) you would like to use.

_Note_: `Shr.setup` will also look for mutations of the DOM and and matching elements will also be setup if they are injected into the DOM after initial setup.

`Shr.setup` returns an array of buttons it setup. Alternatively you can setup an individual button:

```javascript
const button = new Shr('.js-shr', { ...options });
```

### 3. CSS _(optional)_

You don't have to use the Shr CSS. You're free to style the buttons how you like. You can either include the SASS in your build or use the CDN hosted CSS in your `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://shr.one/2.0.0-beta.8/shr.css" />
```

### 4. SVG Sprite (_optional_)

Ir you want to display the icons for each social network as per the demo, you can use the included [SVG sprite](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/). If you already have a sprite system, then you can include the SVG icons as-is. Otherwise, you can use something like [sprite.js](https://gist.github.com/sampotts/15adab33ff3af87f902db0253f0df8dd).

## API

A few useful methods are exposed. To call an API method, you need a reference to the instance. This is returned from `Shr.setup` or your call the the constructor (`new Shr`), e.g.:

```javascript
const button = new Shr('.js-shr-facebook', { ...options });

button
    .getCount()
    .then(count => {
        // Do something with count ðŸ˜Ž
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // Something went wrong ðŸ˜¢
    });
```

| Method             | Parameters | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getCount()`       | -          | Returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will either resolve with a count or an error.                                   |
| `openPopup(event)` | `Event`    | Open the associated dialog. This will be blocked unless it is as a result of user input. We'd suggest calling this as the callback for `addEventListener` or similar and passing the relevant event. |

## Options

There are a ton of options that ship with Shr. These allow you to customize the library to your needs.

### Debugging

_Default_: `false`

If you are are just debugging Shr in a development environment, you can turn on debugging when you setup.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    debug: true,
});
```

### Selector

_Default_: `data-shr-network`

The selector is the attribute on the element that Shr is binding to. This contains the network for the button (ex: `data-shr-network="google"`). You can change this if you want to use a different selector.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    selector: 'data-your-selector-name',
});
```

### Class Name

_Default_: `share-count`

When adding the share count element to the screen, this is the className used to style it.

This is a nested option within the `count` object.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    count: {
        className: 'your-class-name',
    },
});
```

### Display Zero

_Default_: `false`

Sometimes your URL has not been shared yet. You can choose whether or not you want to display 0 shares or not. Some APIs don't allow for the actual count, so those APIs will just be a link to share (such as Twitter) and won't show the count if this is turned on or not.

This is a nested option within the `count` object.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    count: {
        displayZero: true,
    },
});
```

### Format

_Default_: `true`

By default, Shr shortens the amount of shares to an easier to read number. Say you have a URL that went viral and you have over 1 million shares. By default, Shr shows this as 1 M. You can, however, turn this off and show the exact amount of shares.

This is a nested option within the `count` object.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    count: {
        format: false,
    },
});
```

### Position

_Default_: `after`

By default, the number of shares shows up after the social icon. This means it's to the right of the icon. You can change this to be before the social icon (the left of the icon) by setting this value to `before`.

This is a nested option within the `count` object.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    count: {
        position: 'before',
    },
});
```

### Increment

_Default_: `true`

When the user clicks the share icon, we automatically update the count. However, this is assuming that the user went through with the sharing. This is for speed and reactivity. If you don't want this behavior, you can set this value to false.

This is a nested option within the `count` object.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    count: {
        increment: false,
    },
});
```

### HTML

_Default_:

```javascript
function(count, classname, position) {
                return '<span class="' + classname + ' ' + classname + '--' + position + '">' + count + '</span>';
            },
```

This is the method that builds the `<span>` to display the number of the share. If you want, you can override this method to add certain elements or parameters, however it's not recommended. Shr, by default, is very semantic and uses the proper elements when needed. You should be able to style this to get what you are looking for.

This is a nested option within the `count` object.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    count: {
        html: function(count, classname, position) {
            return '{YOUR CONSTRUCTED HTML HERE}';
        },
    },
});
```

### Google

_Default_:

```javascript
    popup: {
        width: 500,
        height: 500
    }
```

For Google, you can define the width and height of the popup used to complete your share. By default, the popup is `500px` by `500px`. To change these values, set them on setup:

```javascript
shr.setup({
    google: {
        popup: {
            width: 1024,
            height: 768,
        },
    },
});
```

### Facebook

_Default_:

```javascript
    popup: {
        width: 640,
        height: 270
    }
```

For Facebook, you can define the width and height of the popup used to complete your share. By default, the popup is `640px` by `270px`. To change these values, set them on setup:

```javascript
shr.setup({
    facebook: {
        popup: {
            width: 1024,
            height: 768,
        },
    },
});
```

### Twitter

_Default_:

```javascript
    popup: {
        width: 640,
        height: 270
    }
```

For Twitter, you can define the width and height of the popup used to complete your share. By default, the popup is `640px` by `270px`. To change these values, set them on setup:

```javascript
shr.setup({
    twitter: {
        popup: {
            width: 1024,
            height: 768,
        },
    },
});
```

### Pinterest

_Default_:

```javascript
    popup: {
        width: 750,
        height: 550
    }
```

For Pinterest, you can define the width and height of the popup used to complete your share. By default, the popup is `750px` by `550px`. To change these values, set them on setup:

```javascript
shr.setup({
    pinterest: {
        popup: {
            width: 1024,
            height: 768,
        },
    },
});
```

### Storage

_Default_:

```javascript
    storage: {
        key: `shr`,
        ttl: 300000
    }
```

To save requests and speed up your site, Shr saves all of the values used to local storage. The two keys you can set are the `key` of the local storage and the time to live (AKA: how long do you want these values to last before we refresh). These can be customized to your liking in the setup like.

The storage `key` must be a valid `JSON` type key meaning it can not contain special characters or whitespace.

The storage `ttl` must be an integer representin the number of seconds the storage is valid for.

```javascript
shr.setup({
    storage: {
        key: `your_key`
        ttl: 100
    }
});
```

## Buttons

Shr provides a ton of networks that can be used on your site. Each button has certain attributes that need to be defined in order for Shr to operate efficiently and effictively. Below are descriptions and an example of each button and how to use it.

### Google Shares

This button allows you to share your URL on Google Plus. A count is not available for this button.

```html
<a
    href="https://plus.google.com/share?url={YOUR_URL_ENCODED_URL}"
    target="_blank"
    class="shr-button shr-button-google"
    data-shr-network="google"
>
    <svg><use xlink:href="#shr-google"></use></svg>+1
</a>
```

When entering the URL you wish to share on Google Plus, make sure that it's properly URL encoded!

### Twitter Shares

This button allows you to tweet a URL on Twitter. A count is not available for this button.

```html
<a
    href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text={URL_ENCODED_TWEET_TEXT}&amp;url={URL_ENCODED_SHARE_URL}&amp;via={TWITTER_USERNAME}"
    target="_blank"
    class="shr-button shr-button-twitter"
    data-shr-network="twitter"
>
    <svg><use xlink:href="#shr-twitter"></use></svg>Tweet
</a>
```

There are 3 variables you can add to your Twitter share:

1. `text` - This is the text of your tweet. Makes ure it's properly URL encoded.
2. `url` - This is the URL you wish to share via Twitter. The URL needs to be properly encoded as well.
3. `via` - This is who is sharing the tweet (your username)

### Pinterest Pins

This button allows you to post a pin to Pinterest. A count is not available for this button.

```html
<a
    href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url={URL_ENCODED_URL}&amp;media={URL_ENCODED_IMAGE_URL}&amp;description={URL_ENCODED_DESCRIPTION}."
    target="_blank"
    class="shr-button shr-button-pinterest"
    data-shr-network="pinterest"
>
    <svg><use xlink:href="#shr-pinterest"></use></svg>Pin it
</a>
```

There are 3 variables you can add to your Pinterest pin:

1. `url` - This is the URL you wish to pin on Pinterest. Make sure it's properly URL encoded.
2. `media` - This is the URL to an image you wish to pin. Make sure it's properly URL encoded.
3. `description` - This is a URL encoded description for your pin.

### Facebook Shares

This button allows you to share on Facebook.

```html
<a
    href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u={URL_ENCODED_URL}"
    target="_blank"
    class="shr-button shr-button-facebook"
    data-shr-network="facebook"
>
    <svg><use xlink:href="#shr-facebook"></use></svg>Share
</a>
```

When entering your URL for Facebook, make sure it's properly URL encoded! The number of shares will appear next to the button for the URL you are sharing.

### GitHub Stars

This button allows you to star a repo on GitHub and shows the current number of stars for the project.

```html
<a href="{{ URL_OF_REPO }}" target="_blank" class="shr-button shr-button-github" data-shr-network="github">
    <svg><use xlink:href="#shr-github"></use></svg>Star
</a>
```
